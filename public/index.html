                    <h3>Card Values</h3>
                    <p>- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</p>
                    <p>- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.</p>
                    <p>- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what's more advantageous for the hand.</p>

                            <p>The player can bet any amount they want from the total money they have available.</p>

                                The player requests an additional card from the dealer. This is done when the player wants to
                                improve their hand total, hoping to get closer to 21 without going over (busting).

                                The player chooses to stop taking cards and ends their turn. This is done when the player is
                                satisfied with their hand total or believes they are in a strong position to beat the
                                dealer.

                                Player must have a hand value higher than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.
                                A winning hand in blackjack pays out at a ratio of 1 to 1 (1:1), but if the player wins with
                                a blackjack, the payout is 3:2.

                                Occurs when the player and the dealer have the same total value for their hands at the end of a round.
                                When this happens, the player neither wins nor loses the bet; instead, the player's original bet is returned.
